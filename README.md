These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Python", fourth edition by Tony Gaddis

<p align="center">How to run these programs from the terminal</p>
- First, check if your have python installed. Run the **python3 --version** from the command line.
- If you don't have python 3 installed, download it from www.python.org.
- To run any of the files from the command line, run **$ python3 filename.py** from the command line.
