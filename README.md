These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Python", fourth edition by Tony Gaddis

<br />

<p align="center">How to run these programs from the terminal</p>
First, check if your have python installed. From the command line, run:
```
$ python3 --version
```
If you don't have python 3 installed, download it from www.python.org.<br />
To run any of the files from the command line, navigate to the correct folder where the file is.
For example, if you want to run app.py:
```
$ python3 app.py
```
