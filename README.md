These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Python", fourth edition by Tony Gaddis

<br />

<p align="center">How to run these programs from the terminal</p>
- First, check if your have python installed. Run<b>$ python3 --version</b> from the command line.<br />
- If you don't have python 3 installed, download it from www.python.org.<br />
- To run any of the files from the command line, run <strong>$ python3 filename.py</strong> from the command line.
