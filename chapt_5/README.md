These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Python", fourth edition by Tony Gaddis<br />

<p align="center">Programming Assignments</p>

<span>1.</span> Kilometer Converter <br />
    Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, then converts that distance to miles. The conversion formula is as
    follows:<br />
    Miles = Kilometers X 0.6214<br />

<span>10.</span> Feet to Inches<br />
    One foot equals 12 inches. Write a function named feet_to_inches that accepts a number of feet as an argument and returns the number of inches
    in that many feet. Use the function in a program that prompts the user to enter a number of feet then displays the number of inches in that many feet.<br />

<span>12.</span> Maximum of Two Values<br />
    Write a function named max that accepts two integer vaules as arguments and returns the value that is the greater of the two. For example, if 7 and 12 are passed as arguments to the function, the function should return 12. Use the function in a program that prompts the user to enter two integer values. The Program should display the value that is the greater of the two.<br />

<span>17.</span> Prime Numbers<br />
    A prime number is a number that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. The number 5 is prime because it can be evenly divided by (only) 1 and 5. The number 6 however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6. <br />
    Write a boolean function named is_prime which takes an integer as an argument and returns true if the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise. Use the function in a program that prompts the user to enter a number, then displays a message indicating whether the number is prime.
