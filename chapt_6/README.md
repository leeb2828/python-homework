These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Python", fourth edition by Tony Gaddis<br />

<p align="center">Programming Assignments</p>

<span>1.</span> File Display<br />
Assume a file containing a series of integers is named numbers.txt and exists on the computer's disk.
Write a program that displays all of the numbers in the file.

<span>2.</span> File Head Display<br />
Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file. The program should display only the
first five lines of the file's contents. If the file contains less than five lines, it should 
display the file's entire contents.

<span>3.</span> Line Numbers<br />
Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file. The program should display the contents
of the file with each line preceded with a line number followed by a colon. The line numbering
should start at 1.

<span>4.</span> Item Counter<br />
Assume a file containing a series of names (as strings) is named names.txt and exists on the
computer's disk. Write a program that displays the number of names that are stored in the file.
Hint: Open the file and read every string stored in it. Use a variable to keep a count of the 
number of items that are read from the file.

<span>5.</span> Sum of Numbers<br />
Assume a file containing a series of integers is named numbers.txt and exists on the computer's
disk. Write a program that reads all of the numbers stored in the file and calculates their total.

<span>6.</span> Average of Numbers<br />
Assume a file containing a series of integers is named numbers.txt and exists on the computer's disk.
Write a program that calculates the average of all the numbers stored in the file.
