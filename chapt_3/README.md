These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Python", fourth edition by Tony Gaddis<br />

<p align="center">Programming Assignments</p>

<span>1.</span>Day of the Week <br />
    Write a program that asks the user for a number in the range of 1 through 7. The program
    should display the corresponding day of the week, where: <br />
    1 = Monday
    2 = Tuesday
    3 = Wednesday 
    4 = Thursday
    5 = Friday
    6 = Saturday
    7 = Sunday <br />
    The program should display an error message if the user enters a number that is outside the range of 
    1 through 7.<br />

<span>2.</span>Areas of Rectangles<br />
    The area of a rectangle is the rectangle's length times its width. Write a program that asks for the
    length and width of two rectangles. The program should tell the user which rectangle has the greater area, or
    if the areas are the same.

<span>3.</span>Age Classifier<br />
    Write a program that asks the user to enter a person's age. The program should display a message indicating 
    whether the person is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult.
    Following are the guidelines:
        - If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
        - If the person is older than 1 year, but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
        - If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20, he or she is a teenager.
        - If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult.

<span>9.</span> Roulette Wheel Colors <br />
    On a roulette wheel, the pockets are numbered from 0 to 36. The colors of the pockets are as follows:
       - Pocket 0 is green.
       - For pockets 1 - 10, the odd-numbered pockets are red and the even-numbered
         pockets are black.
       - For pockets 11 - 18, the odd-numbered are black and the even-numbered are red.
       - For pockets 19 - 28, the odd-numbered are red and the even-numbered are black.
       - For pockets 29 - 36, the odd-numbered are black and the even-numbered are red.

    Write a program that asks the user to enter a pocket number and displays whether the pocket is green, red, or black. The program should display an error message if the user enters a number that is outside the range of 0 through 36. 

<br />

<span>15.</span>Time Calculator <br />
    Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of seconds and works as follows:
      - There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 60,
        the program should convert the number of seconds to minutes and seconds.
      - There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 3,600,
        the program should convert the number of seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.
      - There are 86,400 seconds in a day. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 86,400,
        the program should convert the number of seconds to days, minutes, and seconds.
