These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Python", fourth edition by Tony Gaddis<br />

<p align="center">Programming Assignments</p>

<span>1.</span> Personal Information <br />
   Write a program that displays the following information:
    - Your name
    - Your address
    - Your telephone number
    - Your college major

<span>2.</span> Sales Prediction <br />
    A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent
    of total sales,then displays the profit that will be made from that amount.
    Hint: Use the value 0.23 to represent 23 percent.

<span>3.</span> Land Calculation <br />
    One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Write a program that asks the user to
    enter the total square feet in a tract of land and calculates the number of acres in the tract.
    Hint: Divide the amount entered by 43,560 to get the number of acres.

<span>4.</span> Total Purchase <br />
    A customer in a store is purchasing five items. Write a program that asks for the price of each item,
    then displays the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total.
    Assume the sales tax is 7 percent.

<span>5.</span> Distance Traveled <br />
    Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be
    calculated with the following formula:<br />
    Distance = Speed X Time<br />
    A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
      - The distance the car will travel in 6 hours.
      - The distance the car will travel in 10 hours.
      - The distance the car will travel in 15 hours.
      <br />

<span>8.</span> Tip, Tax, and Total <br />
    Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at
    a restaurant. The program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food,
    then calculate the amounts of a 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. Display
    each of these amounts and the total.

<span>9.</span> Celsius to Fahrenheit Temperature Converter <br />
    Write a program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures.
    The formula is as follows: <br />
    **F = 9/5C + 32** <br />
    The program should ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, then display
    the temperature converted to Fahrenheit.
