These are all the programming assignments I completed for the book "Starting out with Python", fourth edition by Tony Gaddis<br />

<span>10.</span> Tuition Increase <br />
At one college, the tuition for a full-time student is $8,000 per semester.
It has been announced that the tuition will increase by 3 percent each year for the next 5 years. Write a program with a loop that displays the projected semester tuition amount for the next 5 years.

<span>12.</span> Calculating the Factorial of a Number <br />
In mathematics, the notation n! represents the factorial of the nonnegative integer n. The factorial of n is the product of all the nonnegative integers from 1 to n. For example, <br />
       **7!** = 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6 X 7 = **5,040** <br />
and <br />
       **4!** = 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 = **24** <br />
Write a program that lets the user enter a nonnegative integer then uses a loop to calculate the factorial of that number. Display the factorial.
